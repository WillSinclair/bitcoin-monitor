# bitcoin-monitor
A simple Bitcoin price watcher

## Installation
- Make sure you have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) installed.
- Extract to whatever folder you like
- From that folder, run `npm install` (electron takes a while to download and install, so give it ~1m)
- Run `npm start` and enjoy!

## Project Status
- Compiled executables will be coming soon. I just need to polish the app up a bit.
